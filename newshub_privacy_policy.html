  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 07, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>NewsHub (“the App”) is provided by Global Media (“we”, “us”, or “our”). This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. By using the App, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <li><strong>Advertising data.</strong> Ad interactions and identifiers used for delivering and measuring ads (e.g., Google Advertising ID).</li>
    <li><strong>Account data (optional).</strong> If you sign in, we may collect your email and basic profile info to provide account features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve the App’s features and performance</li>

    <li>Show, measure, and improve advertising</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues and abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>We use Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect and process data (including device identifiers) to deliver personalized or non‑personalized ads and to measure performance. You can learn more about Google’s ad practices and your choices here:</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share information with service providers (e.g., Google) that process data on our behalf to provide ads, analytics, and infrastructure. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>

    <li><strong>Analytics controls.</strong> You may opt out of certain analytics collection in device settings where available.</li>

  <p>We keep information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Information may be processed and stored on servers located outside your country. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards when data is transferred.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy in the App and/or via the listing. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect means you accept the revised policy.</p>
